# foe_goods_thresholds
This is a simple script for the game forge of empires "FOE" which     
takes the csv output download from foe_tools for guild daily treasury with      
all options selected and determines good needs by established thresholds.     
I wrote this to help the guild NoRemorse in the us world Angkor.
